                            <p>Safety First! Always obey the rules of the road. Obey all traffic signals, signs, and
                                laws. Get in the mindset of “driving” your bike—not just “riding” your bike. This
                                will help you be a more focused and legally compliant bike rider. </p>

                            <p>For example, sun damage and fading could indicate that you've had your helmet for a long
                                time & therefore is time to switch it up. Things like scuffs and cracks are also a fair
                                indication of extensive wear & damage, meaning you will need to replace your helmet</p>

                        <div class="collapse-content">
                            <p>Depending upon the time period for which the bike was not in use and the prevailing
                                weather conditions at that time, the bike can rust. Rusting is a big problem when it
                                comes to a bike, especially the fuel tank, engine, etc. Rusting is not only superficial;
                                it can happen on the inside as well.</p>

                            <p>Generally, a motorcycle can sit for about a month without someone riding it. However, any
                                longer than that requires it to be properly prepared for storage. If you've never
                                prepared your motorcycle for storage, we have a helpful guide on how to store a
                                motorcycle on our website.</p>
